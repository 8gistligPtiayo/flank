Signals and systems is a core subject for electrical and electronics engineering students, as it deals with the analysis and design of various types of signals and systems, such as continuous-time, discrete-time, linear, nonlinear, time-invariant, time-varying, deterministic, stochastic, causal, non-causal, periodic, aperiodic, etc. The book by RK Kanodia covers all these aspects in a clear and concise manner, with plenty of examples and illustrations.
 
The book is divided into eleven chapters, each containing four exercises of different levels of difficulty. The first exercise consists of theoretical and one line questions, the second exercise contains level 1 problems, the third exercise contains level 2 problems, and the fourth exercise contains mixed questions taken from previous GATE and IES examinations. The detailed solutions to exercises 2, 3 and 4 are given at the end of each chapter.
