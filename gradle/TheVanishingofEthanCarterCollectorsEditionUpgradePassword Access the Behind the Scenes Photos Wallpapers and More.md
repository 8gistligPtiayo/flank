The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a game that blends realism and fantasy in a unique way. The game uses photogrammetry, a technique that scans real-world objects and environments and recreates them in 3D. This results in stunning visuals that make the game world feel alive and immersive. The game also features dynamic lighting and weather effects that change the mood and atmosphere of the game.
 
The game's story is inspired by the works of H.P. Lovecraft, Edgar Allan Poe, and Raymond Chandler. The game follows Paul Prospero, a detective who can communicate with the dead and sense the history of objects. He receives a letter from a young boy named Ethan Carter, who claims to be in danger from his family. Paul travels to Red Creek Valley, a remote and abandoned mining town, to find Ethan and uncover the truth behind his disappearance. Along the way, he encounters various puzzles, clues, and supernatural events that reveal more about the game's mystery.

The game is not a typical horror game, as it does not rely on jump scares or combat. Instead, it focuses on exploration, discovery, and storytelling. The game does not hold the player's hand or provide any guidance. The player is free to roam the game world and interact with anything they find interesting. The game also does not have any fail states or game overs. The player can experience the game at their own pace and in their own way.
